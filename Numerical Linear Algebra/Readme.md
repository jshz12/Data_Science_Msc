The evaluation was based on three projects and a final exam.

The first project was related on direct methods in optimization with constraints. 

On the second one we work on SVD and its applications. 

Finally, on the third one we implement a pagerank algorithm.

_Marks:_

Average mark of the the projects: **9.3**

Final exam: **8.3**
