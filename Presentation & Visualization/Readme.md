The evaluation was based on two projects and a final exam.

On the first project we had to create a visualization (dashboard) using Tableau.

The second project was a presentation in the class, in which we had to create a story related to the visualization made. The goal was to build a **storytelling** through the visualisation made.

The topic chosen was the following: AirBnb data, target audience are ArirBnb hosts (new or experienced) who want to get some insights on current prices, demand and how to offer a better service.

To realize this project I worked with David Íñiguez and Arturo Fredes.
