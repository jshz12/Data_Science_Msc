In the folder we can find another two folders and a tableau file. 

1) In the "Images" folder you can find all the images that we have used in our dashboard. Moreover, we add also two images of the dashboard (just in case). 
2) In the "Data" folder you can find all the data we used to generate the dashboard. Also you can find there a jupyter notebook dealing with the original data.
