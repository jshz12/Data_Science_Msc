The evulation was based on three deliveries and a final exam. 

Assignment 1: The assignment asks to to analyze alternatives to the "first come, first served" principle in different contexts and explore the legitimacy of these alternatives.

Assignmnent 2: The assignment asks to critique a suggested approach for addressing bias in an AI image generator and propose a more nuanced solution.

Assignment 3:  For this problem we’ll use the toy dataset ``problem_set_1_data.csv`. Each row represents a person belonging to one of two demographic groups, denoted by the binary group variable. The task is to predict the binary out­come variable using the continuous features $x_1$ and $x_2$, and possibly also using group. We will compute the demographic disparity of the classifier $f$, train a logistic regression classifier to predict outcome given $x_1$ and $x_2$ and add a term to the loss function that measures the disparity of $f$.
