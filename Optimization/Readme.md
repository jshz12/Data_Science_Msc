The evaluation was based on solving some theoretical exercises, solving some practical exercises and a final exam. 
The aim of the theoretical exercises was to understand the mathematical concepts behind all the algorithms, while in the practical exercises we applied all the studied algorithms.

In practical 1, a basic overview of real analysis is given.

In practical 2, we study the gradient descent algorithm. 

In practical 3, we work on the robustness of the linear regression.

In practical 4, we study constrained optimization, focusing on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions.

In the last two practicals, Practical 5 and 6, we explore Support Vector Machines algorithm. 

All the practical exercises have been realized in collaboration with David Íñiguez.
