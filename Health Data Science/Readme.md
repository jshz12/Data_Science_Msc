The evaluation was based on four deliveries and a final exam.

On the first one, we try to predict if the length of stay (LOS) of the ICU patients are "short" or "long" based on the severity score OASIS of the fisrt 24 hours (and 48 hours) of an ICU stay on MIMIC-III.

On the second assignment, we use the Daily Sports and Activities dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains motion sensor data of 19 daily and sports activities (walking, running, rowing, jumping,...), each performed by 8 subjects in their own style for 5 minutes. The goal of the project was to predict the activity that a user was doing using the time-series data.

The third assignment was based on the creation of a GAN to perform data augmentation for chest X-ray images. Moreover, we were asked to compute the FID and to extract some conclusions.

The last assignment consisted in a brief presentation on a DSxHealth topic. The following paper was studied and presented: A Database Driven Decision Support System: Customized Mortality Prediction. I worked with my David Íñiguez in this assignment.
